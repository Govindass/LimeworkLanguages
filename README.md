Language translations for Govindas Limework Minecraft servers network.

# Rules & Tips
1. If you do not know of a good quality translation for the message, keep it english. Original is better than a bad translation.
2. $1$, $2$, etc. are variables, they may be replaced by player names or numbers, or class names, keep them in right order, do not remove them.
3. Keep commands, for example /help as english, because the server won't be able to recognize command name translations.
4. Focus on making the translation professional, if you do not know of a professional translation, keep it original.
5. It is expected for you to gain help from other people in translation, feel free to ask for help.
6. Do not edit message indexes, such as "Youcanusehelp: You can use /help", "Youcanusehelp:" is the index here. Only translate the part after ":"
7. Do not edit color codes (&, ยง) you may change their order if your translation has changed the order of words, but that's all.
8. You can add a new language by copying LanguageEN.yml file, renaming it into Language[Lang].yml and translating it.
